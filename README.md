# Running the App
Your will need Java 8 in order to run App. openjdk on Ubuntu seems to have issues.
From the parent directory, run:
```
$activator run
```
This should work an all platforms. You can browse to http://localhost:9000 in order to view the App.

You also should not have to start it multiple times. You can just save code, and refresh the page.
